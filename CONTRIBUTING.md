## Getting Started

Before you start contributing, please ensure you have the following prerequisites:

-   [List any prerequisites or dependencies]

## Setting Up the Development Environment

To set up your development environment, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository: git clone https://github.com/n4wf3l/Interschool-VA.git
2. Install dependencies - Open your terminal and typ these commands :

-   npm composer
-   php artisan key:generate
-   cp .env.example .env
-   php artisan migrate
-   npm install
-   npm run dev
-   php artisan serve

3. Configure the project: Laravel uses an .env file for environment-specific configurations. Make sure you have an .env file in the root of your project. You can copy the .env.example file and update it with your configurations. Update the .env file with your database credentials, application key, and other settings. Generate an application key to secure user sessions and other encrypted data(php artisan key:generate). Configure your database settings in the .env file. Set the DB_CONNECTION, DB_HOST, DB_PORT, DB_DATABASE, DB_USERNAME, and DB_PASSWORD. Cache your configuration for better performance (php artisan config:cache). Also, you can clear the cache when you make changes to your configuration (php artisan config:clear). Run migrations to create database tables (php artisan migrate).
4. Run tests: Running tests in a Laravel project involves using PHPUnit, which is the default testing framework for Laravel. Laravel provides a convenient set of testing tools and helpers to make testing your applications easier. Here's how you can run tests in Laravel: Create Tests (php artisan make:test ExampleTest), Write Test Cases, Run Tests (php artisan test - php artisan test tests/Feature/ExampleTest.php - vendor/bin/phpunit), Testing Environment (cp .env .env.testing) and Database Migrations (php artisan migrate --env=testing).
